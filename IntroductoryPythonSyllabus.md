  > **In Class**: Login to our JupyterHub. In the ClassMaterial->Lesson2 folder find the VariablesAndOperators_InClass notebook.  This copy of the notebook is READ-ONLY, you cannot modify it.  You have to make a copy of the notebook in your personal JupyterHub area.  Once you open it run through the in class exercises.  These exercises will allow you to get comfortable with the Jupyter Notebook.  In this notebook you will write your first python program, **_"Hello World"_**.  You will Use python as a calculator.   Given the code to generate random numbers, write your first basic algorithm.  Use markdown cells in your notebook and add your name and other information in it.

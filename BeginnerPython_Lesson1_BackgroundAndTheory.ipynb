    "\n",
    " A computer is an electronic machine that processes informationâ€”in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine if a computer were a person. Suppose you have a friend who's really good at math. She is so good that everyone she knows posts their math problems to her.  Each morning, she goes to her letterbox and finds a pile of new math problems waiting for her attention. She piles them up on her desk until she gets around to looking at them. Each afternoon, she takes a letter off the top of the pile, studies the problem, works out the solution, and scribbles the answer on the back. She puts this in an envelope addressed to the person who sent her the original problem and sticks it in her out tray, ready to post. Then she moves to the next letter in the pile. You can see that your friend is working just like a computer. Her letterbox is her input; the pile on her desk is her memory; her brain is the processor that works out the solutions to the problems; and the out tray on her desk is her output.\n",

    "**A little history about the computer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have come a long way.  The electronic computer traces its origin to the 1950's.  They used to be the size of rooms and require a number of technicians and operators to keep them up and running.  The early use was primarily solving math problems, which computers - when programmed for it - can do very well.  This computer below was one of the first supercomputers!  It was called the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer).\n",
    "\n",
    "![eniac](images/eniac.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs that ran these computers used to be printed on cards like the one below, thousands of these cards would be read into memory and that would be the program the computer ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "![punch cards](images/ibmCard.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the program was printed to paper.\n",
    "These early computers used vacuum tubes that got very hot and needed alot of cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![vacuum tubes](images/vactubes.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers did not start shrinking until the transistor was invented.  The transistor did the same thing that the vacuum tube did but was easier to manage.  We'll talk about what transistors do in a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "![transistors](images/transis.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon transistors got even smaller.  They got so small that you could fit thousands of them on the size of a quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cpu](images/cpu.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We went from the computers shown above to the ones you have on your desk.  They became more powerful too, the Eniac could do 5000 calculations per second.  Todays desktops can do about 3 billion!  \n",

    "**What are programs and programming languages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In it's simplest form a computer program is a set of instructions that describes a task to a computer.  We load this program into the computers memory and then it is executed by the computer.\n",

    "This is what computers understand.  This is called binary and only two characters are allowed 1 and 0.  Each character is called a bit.  A group of 8 bits is called a byte.  As you can see it's not the most convenient thing for humans to communicate it.  This is why we created programming languages.  It is easier for humans to give instructions to computers this way.  The programming language eventually gets converted to binary and is executed by the computer.\n",

    "Python as you can see, is one of the most popular programming languages today.  Every year it increases its share a litle bit.  Part of the reason is that Python has been described as a language where \"batteries are included\".  There are many libraries (shared code) that already do what you are most likely trying to do.  Python was created by Guido Von Rossum in the mid-1980's.\n",

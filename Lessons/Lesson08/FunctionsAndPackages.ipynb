    "A function is a mathematical concept that Computer Science borrowed and adopted.  \n",
    "Computers are great at managing large amounts of data.  They are also great at doing the same thing over and over again - without getting bored.  In mathematics:\n",
    "A function is a process or a relation that associates each element x of a set X, the domain of the function, to a single element y of another set Y (possibly the same set), the codomain of the function. If the function is called f, this relation is denoted y = fâ€Š(x) (read f of x), the element x is the argument or input of the function, and y is the value of the function, the output, or the image of x by f.[2] The symbol that is used for representing the input is the variable of the function (one often says that f is a function of the variable x). \n",

    "A function is a process or a relation that associates each element x of a set X, the domain of the function, to a single element y of another set Y (possibly the same set), the codomain of the function. If the function is called f, this relation is denoted y = fâ€Š(x) (read f of x), the element x is the argument or input of the function, and y is the value of the function, the output, or the image of x by f.\n",

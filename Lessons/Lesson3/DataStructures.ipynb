    "A function is a piece of code that is already defined, performs a steps, and can return a result.  We have seen some functions already.  ***print*** is a function, ***type*** is a function, ***id*** is a function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a set of functions builtin that we can use when we need to.  We are going to investigate a few."

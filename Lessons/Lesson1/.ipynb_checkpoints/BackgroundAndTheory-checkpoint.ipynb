    "\n",
    "Everyone \"knows\" what a computer is, but do you know what is inside a computer?  What it was originally designed to do?  A computer is an electronic machine that processes information: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A little history about the computer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have come a long way.  The electronic computer traces its origin to the 1950's.  At that time only the government, or large corporations could afford them.  They used to be the size of rooms and require a number of technicians and operators to keep them up and running.  The early use was primarily solving math problems, which computers - when programmed for it - can do very well.  This computer below was one of the first supercomputers!  It was called the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer).  The computer as we know it, didn't really exist until the 1980's.  Only then did it become cheap enough that people could afford it in their own home.\n",

    "![eniac](images/eniac.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs that ran these computers used to be printed on cards like the one below, thousands of these cards would be read into memory and that would be the program the computer ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "![punch cards](images/ibmCard.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the program was printed to paper.\n",
    "These early computers used vacuum tubes, al electronic component, that got very hot and needed alot of cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![vacuum tubes](images/vactubes.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers did not start shrinking until vacuum tubes were replaced by the transistor.  The transistor did the same thing that the vacuum tube did but was easier to manage.  We'll talk about what transistors do in a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "![transistors](images/transis.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon transistors got even smaller.  They got so small that you could fit thousands of them on the size of a quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cpu](images/cpu.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We went from the computers shown above to the ones you have on your desk.  They became more powerful too, the Eniac could do 5000 calculations per second.  Todays desktops can do about 3 billion!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the main parts of a computer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware and software - A computer is composed to two different kinds of components.  The **hardware** is the physical pieces that create the machine.  These are:\n",
    "+ input\n",
    "> keyboard, mouse, any other device that captures information from the real world and turns it into a computer input\n",
    "+ output\n",
    "> monitor, speakers, printer\n",
    "+ storage\n",
    "> hard drive, usb drive, external drive\n",

    "> computers internal memory that is used to store information and programs that the computer is currently working on, this is also described as RAM\n",
    "+ cpu\n",
    "> the computers \"brain\", this is the component that coordinates the actions of the other components, as well as executes program instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The **software** part is all the programs that run on top of this hardware.  This includes the operating system that is responsible for controlling the different parts of hardware and all the programs that run on top of the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are programs and programming languages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply a computer program is a set of instructions that describe a task to a computer.  We load this program into the computers memory and then it is executed by the computer.  The output that is generated is dependent on the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        print('Hello World!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet above can be considered a complete program.  It doesn't do much, but it is valid.  The computer does not understand what is written above. It needs to be traslated to something that the computer knows how to manipulate. The program above eventually gets traslated to this:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is what computers understand.  This is called binary and only two characters are allowed 1 and 0.  Each character is called a bit.  A group of 8 bits is called a byte.  As you can see it's not the most convenient thing for humans to communicate it.  This is why we created programming languages.  It is easier for humans to give instructions to computers this way.  The programming language eventually gets converted to binary and is executed by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bytes are related to data size on a computer.  The different measures are:\n",

It's like human languages, you can say the same thing in many different languages.  They all look different, but in the end they are trying to achieve the same thing. They are trying to give the computer instructions on how to do a task.  \n",

    "Python as you can see, is one of the most popular programming languages today.  Every year it increases its share a litle bit.  Part of the reason is that Python has been described as a language where \"batteries are included\".  There are many libraries (shared code) that already do what you are most likely trying to do.  Python was created by Guido Von Rossum in the mid-1980's.\n",

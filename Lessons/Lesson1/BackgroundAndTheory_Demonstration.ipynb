In the notebook you have two kinds of cells, code, and text (aka markdown).  Homework will be done in a notebook.  You will download the homework template each week.  In it there will be cells that have instructions and cells where you are supposed to write code.  Once you are done with your homework you will make a copy of the notebook on your laptop (or chromebook) and then you will email this copy to me.\n",

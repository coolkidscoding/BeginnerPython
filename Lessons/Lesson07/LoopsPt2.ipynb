    "Last week we discussed a **_while_** loop.  A **_while_** loop uses a condition to determine whether or not we enter the loop.  If the condition is True we enter, when the condition is False we exit the loop.  So in a **_while_** we do something over and over again until a condition becomes False.\n",

    "A **_while_** loop was ideal for looping over until a conditional turned to False, but what if I had a data structure and wanted to loop over all the elements in the data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the **_for_** loop is ideally suited for.  In a **_for_** loop we loop over every item in a data structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the **_for_** is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for <loop_variable_name> in <data_structure>:\n",
    "    <loop_body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **data_structure** above refers to the data structure that we are going to loop over.  The **loop_variable_name** is just a variable that will be assigned the current element from the data structure.  Every iteration of the loop the value assigned to the loop variable will change."

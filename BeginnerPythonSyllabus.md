  + Why do we need functions?
  + What can we do with functions?

  > Take reusability up a level, introduce packages
    + What is a package?
    + Why do we need packages?
    + Discuss fundamental packages
      + sys
      + env
      + math
      + csv

  > **In Class**: Use the help system to identify functions available in various packages.  

  > **Homework**: Read a file of data, for every keyword in the file accumulate statistics.  Store those statistics in data structures and report them as output.

+ **Lesson 7:  Handling Exceptions**
  > What happens if an error happens?
  
  + Describe situations where errors may occur?
  + Demonstrate programs with exceptions and programs without.
  + Describe the exception mechanism.
  > **In Class**: Given a list of data, write a program that performs various mathematical manipulations on that data.  Your program has to handle missing or incorrect data correctly.

  > **Homework**: \<fill this in>

+ **Lesson 8: Built In Packages**
  > Describe and demonstrate functionality in well known packages.
  + numpy
  + scipy
  + pandas
  + scikit-learn
